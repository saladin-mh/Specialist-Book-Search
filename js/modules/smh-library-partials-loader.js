/**
 * SMH Library: Load reusable HTML partials into the current document.
 * 
 * This utility injects key components such as navigation, footer, and toast messages
 * into designated placeholder elements, maintaining layout consistency across all pages.
 *
 * Advantages:
 * - Reduces code repetition and promotes DRY principle.
 * - Ensures consistent updates across navigation and layout components.
 * - Uses asynchronous fetch with error resilience and developer feedback.
